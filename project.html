        <p><strong><u>Project sponsor:  engaged, dedicated, driving, inspiring…what else can you ask for?</u></strong><br><br>
Several members of the Apple executive team tried to convince Jobs that producing a phone was a great idea. But Steve was sceptical and rejected it many times. Linked to the previous point, Jobs attitude shows how an executive sponsor should behave: being a powerful source of inspiration, a fierce curator of good ideas, yet not afraid of rejecting the bad or half-baked ones. <br><br>

Not only in the approval of the project did he a top of the class job, but also throughout the entire project he was fully engaged to it, dedicating approximately 40% of his time to supervise and lead the teams. Besides during M&A work, I have hardly ever seen such a committed and engaged project sponsor.<br><br>

If you are an executive and you want to carry out strategic initiatives or transform your business successfully, take note of these two invaluable lessons from Steve Jobs from the iPhone project:<br><br>

Push back on ideas till they are mature to launch a full-scale project
Ensure that after the go-ahead, you dedicate at least 20% of your time to support the project.<br><br>

    <p><strong><u>Communication: fiercely secret outside, fluid within the project</u></strong><br><br>
One of the typical Apple characteristics of the Purple project was that it was immediately deemed top secret, an absolute top-to-bottom secrecy, in line with its legendary ferocity in safeguarding new product announcements. The project touched nearly every department within Apple itself, and all the third parties involved in developing the iPhone, including Cingular, Google, Yahoo and Foxconn.<br><br>

Apple does make it clear to employees and business partners that they will be dismissed and possibly prosecuted for leaking company secrets. Not even cleaning personnel had access to the project room.<br><br>

This secrecy with the project is a contradiction to project management best practices, which, as you have heard me saying several times, communication is key, especially during the execution of the project. My take is that even if the communication outside the project was totally forbidden, the communication within the team was outstanding, particularly with the executive team.<br><br>

For all these reasons, and all the best practices that were applied, we can consider the iPhone project to be the best commercial project in history.<br><br>

        <p><strong><u>Business case: a $500 billion jackpot!</u></strong><br><br>
According to one estimate, Apple spent $150m developing the iPhone. That $150m surely ranks the Purple project as one of the best investments ever.<br><br>

From the information available, I was not able to find any reliable predictions, nor cost benefit analysis, about the potential sales Apple was expecting from the iPhone. The numbers were huge according to the gut feeling of several executives, yet nobody was expecting that the iPhone would change Apple’s business so profoundly.<br><br>

Apple sold 1.4 million iPhones in 2007 to more than 201 million units worldwide in 2016. In total, Apple has sold more than one billion iPhones worldwide from 2007 to 2016.<br><br>

In the first quarter of 2017, iPhone sales accounted for more than 69 percent of Apple’s total revenue, with an estimated margin above 50%, generating more than 54 billion U.S. dollars in revenues. In ten years, Apple’s revenue grew from 8 billion U.S. dollars in 2004 to more than 215 billion in 2016.
